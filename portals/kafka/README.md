# Kafka

Send end-to-end encrypted Kafka messages - from any producer, to any consumer, _through_ any Kafka Broker.

[<mark style="color:blue;">Ockam</mark>](../../) encrypts Kafka messages so that only the consumer can decrypt it. This gives the guarantee of tamper-proof data transfer and eliminate exposure in case the Kafka messages are exposed.
