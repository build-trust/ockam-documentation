# Amazon EC2

This hands-on example uses [<mark style="color:blue;">Ockam</mark>](../../../) to create an end-to-end **encrypted portal** to MongoDB.

We connect a nodejs app in one AWS VPC with a MongoDB database that resides in another AWS VPC. The example uses AWS CLI to create these VPCs.

To understand the details of how end-to-end trust is established, and how the portal works even though the two networks are isolated with no exposed ports, please read: ‚Äú[<mark style="color:blue;">How does Ockam work?</mark>](../../../how-does-ockam-work.md)‚Äù

## Run

This example requires Bash, Git, Curl, and AWS CLI. Please set up these tools for your operating system, then run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the Ockam repo from Github.
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/build-trust/ockam && cd ockam

# Navigate to this example‚Äôs directory.
cd examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc

# Run the example, use Ctrl-C to exit at any point.
./run.sh
```

If everything runs as expected, you'll see the message: _The example run was successful ü•≥_

## Walkthrough

The [<mark style="color:blue;">run.sh script</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh), that you ran above, and its [<mark style="color:blue;">accompanying files</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/tree/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc) are full of comments and meant to be read. The example setup is only a few simple steps, so please take some time to read and explore.

### Administrator

- The [<mark style="color:blue;">run.sh script</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh) calls the [<mark style="color:blue;">run function</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L14) which invokes the [<mark style="color:blue;">enroll command</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L15-L27) to create a new identity, sign into Ockam Orchestrator, set up a new Ockam project, make you the administrator of this project, and get a project membership [<mark style="color:blue;">credential</mark>](../../../reference/protocols/identities.md#credentials).
- The run function then [<mark style="color:blue;">generates two new enrollment tickets</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L29-L45). The tickets are valid for 10 minutes. Each ticket can be redeemed only once and assigns [<mark style="color:blue;">attributes</mark>](../../../reference/protocols/identities.md#credentials) to its redeemer. The [<mark style="color:blue;">first ticket</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L29-L37) is meant for the Ockam node that will run in Bank Corp.‚Äôs network. The [<mark style="color:blue;">second ticket</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L39-L45) is meant for the Ockam node that will run in Analysis Corp.‚Äôs network.
- In a typical production setup, an administrator or provisioning pipeline generates enrollment tickets and gives them to nodes that are being provisioned. In our example, the run function is acting on your behalf as the administrator of the Ockam project. It passes the enrollment tickets as a [<mark style="color:blue;">function argument </mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L55C37-L55C56) to provision Ockam nodes in Bank Corp network and also passes the enrollment key as an [<mark style="color:blue;">function argument </mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L55C41-L55C64) to provision Ockam nodes in Analysis Corp.‚Äôs network.
- For Bank Corp, the run function calls a [<mark style="color:blue;">run.sh script</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L55) which will create an Amazon VPC that will host our MongoDB instance over a closed network this will be hosted by Bank Corp.
- For Analysis Corp, we will also call a [<mark style="color:blue;">run.sh script</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/run.sh#L55) which will run a nodejs app that will write to our mongoDB data hosted by Bank Corp.

### Bank Corp

First, the `bank_corp/run.sh` script creates a network to host the database:

- We [create a VPC](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L11-L12) and tag it.
- We [create an Internet gateway](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L15-L16) and attach it to the VPC.
- We [create a route table](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L19) and [create a route](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/apis/nodejs/amazon_ec2/aws_cli/monitoring_corp/run.sh#L20) to the Internet via the gateway.
- We [create a subnet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L23-L27), and associate it with the route table.
- We finally [create a security group](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L32-L34) so that there is:
  - [One TCP egress to the Internet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L34),
  - No Outbound connection is allowed for this VPC

Then, the `bank_corp/run.sh` script creates an EC2 instance where the Ockam outlet node will run:

- We [select an AMI](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L40-L42).
- We [start an instance using the AMI](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L48-L50) above and a start script based on `run_ockam.sh` where the

  [`ENROLLMENT_TICKET` is replaced by the enrollment ticket](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L44) created by the administrator and given as a parameter to `run.sh`.

- We [tag the created instance](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L48) and [wait for it to be available](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run.sh#L49).

Next, the instance is started and the `run_ockam.sh` script is executed:

- [MongoDB is installed using yum package installer](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run_ockam.sh#L10-L20)
- The [`ockam` executable is installed](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run_ockam.sh#L23-L25).
- The [enrollment ticket is used to create a default identity and make it a project member](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run_ockam.sh#L40).
- We then create an Ockam node:
  - With [a TCP outlet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run_ockam.sh#L52).
  - A [policy associated to the outlet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run_ockam.sh#L51). The policy authorizes identities with a credential containing the attribute monitoring-api-inlet="true".
  - With [a relay](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/bank_corp/run_ockam.sh#L50) capable of forwarding the TCP traffic to the TCP outlet.

#### Analysis Corp

First, the `analysis_corp/run.sh` script creates a network to host the nodejs application:

- We [create a VPC](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L11-L12) and tag it.
- We [create an Internet gateway](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L15-L16) and attach it to the VPC.
- We [create a route table](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L19) and [create a route](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L20) to the Internet via the gateway.
- We [create a subnet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L23-L27), and associate it with the route table.
- We finally [create a security group](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L32-L33) so that there is:
  - [One TCP egress to the Internet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L34),
  - And [One SSH ingress](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L35) to download and install the nodejs application.

Then, we create an EC2 instance where the Ockam inlet node will run:

- We [select an AMI](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L40-L42).
- We [start an instance using the AMI](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L48-L50) above and a start script based on `run_ockam.sh` where the

  [`ENROLLMENT_TICKET` is replaced by the enrollment ticket](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L47) created by the administrator and given as a parameter to `run.sh`.

Next, the instance is started and the `run_ockam.sh` script is executed:

- The [`ockam` executable is installed](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run_ockam.sh#10).
- The [enrollment ticket is used to create a default identity and make it a project member](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run_ockam.sh#L26).
- We then create an Ockam node:
  - With [a TCP inlet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run_ockam.sh#L37).
  - A [policy associated to the inlet](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run_ockam.sh#L36). The policy authorizes identities with a credential containing the attribute monitoring-api-outlet="true".

Finally, we wait for the instance to be ready and run the nodejs app application:

- The [app.js file](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh/app.js) is [copied to the instance](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L56) (this uses the previously created `key.pem` file to identify).
- We can then [SSH to the instance](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L57-L61) and:
  - [Install nodejs](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L59).
  - [Run the nodejs client application](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/examples/command/portals/databases/mongodb/amazon_vpc/analysis_corp/run.sh#L60-L61).

### Recap

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/mongodb-portal.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We connected a nodejs app in one AWS VPC with a MongoDB database in another AWS VPC over an end-to-end encrypted portal.

Non-public access to MongoDB database are only accessible to enrolled members of the project with the appropriate attributes. The communication channel is [mutually authenticated](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols/secure-channels) and [authorized](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols/access-controls). Keys and credentials are automatically rotated. Access to the API can be easily revoked.

Analysis Corp. does not get unfettered access to Banking Corp.‚Äôs network. It only gets access to run queries on the MongoDB server. Bank Corp. does not get unfettered access to Travel App Corp.‚Äôs network. It gets access only to respond to requests over a tcp connection. Bank Corp. cannot initiate connections.

All [access controls](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols/access-controls) are secure-by-default. Only project members, with valid credentials, can connect with each other. NAT‚Äôs are traversed using a relay and outgoing tcp connections. Neither Bank Corp. nor Analysis App Corp. expose any listening endpoints to the Internet. Their networks are completely closed and protected from any attacks from the Internet.
