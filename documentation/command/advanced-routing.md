# Relays and Portals

In the [<mark style="color:blue;">previous section</mark>](routing.md), we learned how Ockam Routing and Transports create a foundation for end-to-end application layer protocols. When discussing [<mark style="color:blue;">Transports</mark>](routing.md#transports)<mark style="color:blue;">,</mark> we put together a specific example communication topology – a transport <mark style="color:orange;">bridge</mark>.

## Bridges

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (2) (2).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

Node `n1` wishes to access a service on node `n3`, but it can't directly connect to `n3`. This can happen for many reasons, maybe because `n3` is in a separate `IP` subnet, or it could be that the communication from `n1 to n2` uses UDP while from `n2 to n3` uses TCP or other similar constraints. The topology makes `n2` a bridge or gateway between these two separate networks to enable end-to-end protocols between `n1` and `n3` even though they are not directly connected.

## Relays

It is common, however, to encounter communication topologies where the machine that provides a service is unwilling or is not allowed to open a listening port or <mark style="color:orange;">expose</mark> a bridge node to other networks. This is a common security best practice in enterprise environments, home networks, OT networks, and VPCs across clouds. Application developers may not have control over these choices from the infrastructure / operations layer. This is where [<mark style="color:blue;">relays</mark>](advanced-routing.md#relays) are useful.

Relays make it possible to establish end-to-end protocols with services operating in a remote private network, without requiring a remote service to expose listening ports to an outside hostile network like the Internet.

[<mark style="color:blue;">Delete any existing nodes</mark>](nodes.md#nodes) and then try this new example:

```
» ockam node create n2 --tcp-listener-address=127.0.0.1:7000

» ockam node create n3
» ockam service start hop --at n3
» ockam relay create n3 --at /node/n2 --to /node/n3
     ✔︎ Now relaying messages from /node/n2/service/25716d6f86340c3f594e99dede6232df → /node/n3/service/forward_to_n3

» ockam node create n1
» ockam tcp-connection create --from n1 --to 127.0.0.1:7000
» ockam message send hello --from n1 --to /worker/603b62d245c9119d584ba3d874eb8108/service/forward_to_n3/service/uppercase
HELLO
```

In this example, the direction of the second TCP connection is reversed in comparison to our first example that used a bridge. `n2` is the only node that has to listen for TCP connections.

Node `n2` is running a relay service. `n3` makes an outgoing TCP connection to `n2` and requests a forwarding address from the relay service. `n3` then becomes reachable via `n2` at the address `/service/forward_to_n3`.

Node `n1` connects with `n2` and routes messages to `n3` via its forwarding relay.

The message in the above example took the following route. This is very similar to our [<mark style="color:blue;">earlier example</mark>](routing.md#transport) except for the direction of the second TCP connection. The relay worker remembers the route to back to `n3`. `n1` just has to get the message to the forwarding relay and everything just works.

Using this simple topology rearrangement, Ockam [Routing](routing.md) makes it possible to establish end-to-end protocols between applications that are running in completely private networks.

We can traverse NATs and pierce through network boundaries. And since this is all built using a very simple [application layer routing](routing.md) protocol, we can have any number of transport connection hops in any transport protocol, and we can mix-match bridges with relays to create <mark style="color:orange;">end-to-end protocols in</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">**any**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">communication topology</mark>.

## Portals <a href="#portal" id="portal"></a>

Portals make existing protocols work over Ockam Routing without changing any code in the existing applications.

Continuing from our [<mark style="color:blue;">Relays</mark>](advanced-routing.md#relays) example, create a Python-based web server to represent a sample web service. This web service is listening on `127.0.0.1:9000`.

```
» python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 9000

» ockam tcp-outlet create --at n3 --from /service/outlet --to 127.0.0.1:9000
» ockam tcp-inlet create --at n1 --from 127.0.0.1:6000 \
    --to /worker/603b62d245c9119d584ba3d874eb8108/service/forward_to_n3/service/hop/service/outlet

» curl --head 127.0.0.1:6000
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
...
```

Then create a TCP Portal Outlet that makes `127.0.0.1:9000` available on worker address `/service/outlet` on `n3`. We already have a forwarding relay for `n3` on `n2` at `service/forward_to_n3`.

We then create a TCP Portal Inlet on `n1` that will listen for TCP connections to `127.0.0.1:6000`. For every new connection, the inlet creates a portal following the `--to` route all the way to the outlet. As it receives TCP data, it chunks and wraps them into Ockam Routing messages and sends them along the supplied route. The outlet receives Ockam Routing messages, unwraps them to extract TCP data and sends that data along to the target web service on `127.0.0.1:9000`. It all just seamlessly works.

The HTTP requests from curl enter the inlet on `n1`, travel to `n2`, and are relayed back to `n3` via its forwarding relay to reach the outlet and onward to the Python-based web service. Responses take the same return route back to curl.

The TCP Inlet/Outlet work for a large number of TCP-based protocols like HTTP. It is also simple to implement portals for other transport protocols. There is a growing base of Ockam Portal Add-Ons in our [<mark style="color:blue;">GitHub Repository</mark>](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

Ockam [<mark style="color:blue;">Routing</mark>](routing.md#routing) and [<mark style="color:blue;">Transports</mark>](routing.md#transports) combined with the ability to model [<mark style="color:blue;">Bridges</mark>](advanced-routing.md) and [<mark style="color:blue;">Relays</mark>](advanced-routing.md#relays) make it possible to <mark style="color:orange;">create end-to-end, application layer protocols in</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">**any**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">communication topology</mark> - across networks, clouds, and boundaries.

[<mark style="color:blue;">Portals</mark>](advanced-routing.md#portal) take this powerful capability a huge step forward by making it possible to apply these end-to-end protocols and their guarantees to existing applications, <mark style="color:orange;">without changing any code!</mark>

This lays the foundation to make <mark style="color:orange;">both new and existing</mark> applications - end-to-end encrypted and secure-by-design.
