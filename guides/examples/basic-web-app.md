# Basic Web App

This is a demo that shows how to use Ockam
[sidecars](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) to
connect a traditional web app to a postgres database, with minimal/no code changes.

In order to follow along, please first make sure that all the prerequisites listed below
have been installed on the machine where you will be carrying out these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Ockam Command](../../#install)
  - After successfully installing this prerequisite, you will be able to run the `ockam`
    CLI app in your terminal.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and libraries: [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/),
  [psycopg2](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2)
  1. After successfully installing Python, you will be able to run `python3` command in
     your terminal.
  2. Instructions on how to get the dependencies (`Flask`, `psycopg2`) are provided in the
     [Python Code](#python-code) section below.
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  1. After successfully installing this prerequisite, you will be able to run the
     Postgres database server on your machine on the default port of `5432`.
  2. Make sure to set a new password for the database user `postgres`. Set this password
     to be `password` (the Python Code below uses `postgres:password@localhost` as the
     connection string for the db driver). The following directions can help you set this
     up on Linux or macOS:
     - In a terminal, login to the database locally as the `postgres` user:
       `sudo -u postgres psql --username postgres --password --dbname template1`
     - Then type the following in the REPL: `ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'password';`, and
       finally type `exit`.
     - You can learn more about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12721095/2085356).

### The Web App

In this demo we're going to take a very basic Python Flask app that simply increments a
counter in a Postgres database, and move the connection between the application and
database to be through an Ockam secure channel.

Before we get started, let's imagine a company where this going to be rolled out, where we
find 3 team members who will be involved in this journey:

- üßë‚Äçü¶≤ Toby is the admin for all the Ockam "things".
    - They are responsible for installing Ockam Command (using `ockam enroll` which is in
      the first prerequisite).
    - And then generating two
      [one-time enrollment tickets](https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-project-ticket.html)
      and sharing them w/ the rest of the team:
        1. One for the web app,
        2. Another for the database server.
- üßë‚Äçü¶± Akira is the database admin.
  - They use their one-time enrollment ticket to perform
    some configuration steps and setup an
    ["outlet"](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/advanced-routing).
  - We will learn more
    about this in the ["Moving the database"](#moving-the-database) section below.
- üßë‚Äçü¶≥ Zora is the web app (Python Flask) developer.
  - They use their one-time enrollment
    ticket to perform some configuration steps and setup an
    ["inlet"](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/advanced-routing).
  - We will learn more
    about this in the ["Connecting the web app"](#connecting-the-web-app) section below.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/web-app-ex-1.svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

In the rest of the instructions we will walk you through which of the team members might
be performing these steps. But as you are following along, you can do them all yourself
üòÉ. The story and these people and roles are just to help in understanding the context
around what is happening as we go through the steps.

#### Python Code

To get started, we've put everything into a single file (called `main.py`) here for the
sake of readability for this demo:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
import os
import psycopg2
from flask import Flask

CREATE_TABLE = (
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);"
)

INSERT_RETURN_ID = "INSERT INTO events (name) VALUES (%s) RETURNING id;"

app = Flask(__name__)
url = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost/"
connection = psycopg2.connect(url)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    with connection:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(CREATE_TABLE)
            cursor.execute(INSERT_RETURN_ID, ("",))
            id = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    return "I've been visited {} times".format(id), 201
```
{% endcode %}

Lines 12 and 13 are where we establish out connection to the database, at this point it's
simply pointing to `localhost`. If you're running a local postgres instance then starting
this Flask app will now show you how many times you've visited it, storing each new visit
in the database.

Before doing any Ockam related tasks, feel free to run the Python script now by following
the instructions below:
1. You also need to add following Python dependencies by running:
    - `Flask`: `pip3 install flask`
    - `psycopg2`: `pip3 install psycopg2-binary`
2. To run this `Flask` app (`main.py`) type:
    - `flask --app main run`
3. To see it running in a web browser open this URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Moving the database

Before we can add Ockam into the mix, first lets change the port that the database server
is listening on to `5433` (_the default port is `5432`_). This will ensure that we're not
simply using the existing communication channel.

There are two approaches to doing this:
1. running a new postgres instance in a Docker container with a different port, or
2. changing the port that your local postgres server.

The following are directions on changing the port that your local postgres server is
listening on to `5433`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux & macOS" %}
You can either:
1. Use [`pg_ctl`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-ctl.html#R2-APP-PGCTL-3)
   that is included in the binaries for your postgres installation.
2. Or you can change it
   [directly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/187438/change-pgsql-port).
    - Edit the `/etc/postgresql/<VERSION>/main/postgresql.conf` file, where `<VERSION>` is
      the version of the database server that you have installed.
    - Find the line where the `port` is listed and change it to `port = 5433`.
    - Save the file.
    - Restart the postgres server.
      - On Linux run `sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service` to let the new port take
        effect.
      - On macOS, you can find the instructions
        [here](https://databasefaqs.com/restart-postgres/) on how to restart it.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Other Systems" %}
Please read this
[tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql/)
on how to configure Postgres server on Windows.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Optional:
- If you want `main.py` to connect directly (without Ockam) to your database, you have to
  specify this port in the connection string:
  `url = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5433/"`.
  You can use this to test if the new port is up and running.

> [one-time enrollment ticket](https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-project-ticket.html)
> (just plain text) and then send that over to Akira. You can simply follow these steps on

{% hint style="info" %}
Before starting with the steps below, please read
[this article](https://docs.ockam.io/guides/use-cases/add-end-to-end-encryption-to-any-client-and-server-application-with-no-code-change)
to get familiar with what steps we are going to take to configured Ockam. They will give
you a sense of things like "node", "inlet", "outlet", and "relay" that you will see
mentioned below.
{% endhint %}

To allow the database to enroll itself as a node with Ockam we first need to generate a
one-time enrollment ticket for that node:

```bash
export DB_TOKEN=$(ockam project ticket --attribute component=db)
```

Here's a diagram describing what we will do next. Note how the database connection string
used by the Python Flask app connects to port `5432` and Ockam "magically" secures &
relays the connection to port `5433` where Postgres is now running, all without writing
any code üéâ.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/web-app-ex-2.svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

We've specified a custom attribute here called `component` and given it a value of `db`,
which we can use later to identify this node. We've also stored the output of the command
to an environment variable, though you could also copy it to your clipboard or
output it to a file depending on your needs.

> follow these steps on your machine.

In the code snippet below, we're going to:
1. Create and enroll a new Ockam [node](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/nodes) on
   our project, we'll add a [policy](https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-policy.html)
   that ensures only a component with the value `web` will be authorized to establish a
   new connection.
2. We'll connect our node to our changed Postgres port (note the `PG_PORT` value).
3. Finally we'll setup a forwarder (we will use the End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Relay
   service, which was provisioned when `ockam enroll` was run, in the `default` project at
   `/project/default`) that will allow traffic to this node to flow through to our TCP
   outlet.

```bash
export PG_PORT=5433
ockam identity create db
ockam project enroll $DB_TOKEN --identity db
ockam node create db --identity db
ockam policy create --at db --resource tcp-outlet --expression '(= subject.component "web")'
ockam tcp-outlet create --at /node/db --from /service/outlet --to 127.0.0.1:$PG_PORT
ockam relay create db --to /node/db --at /project/default
```

### Connecting the web app

With our database node now running, we need to connect a corresponding node on the web
side. We'll start by creating another enrollment token, this time for a `component`
labelled `web`:

```bash
export WEB_TOKEN=$(ockam project ticket --attribute component=web)
```

> In our story about our imaginary company and team of three, the following steps would
> have been performed by Zora, our web app developer. Zora would use the one-time
> enrollment ticket data (plain text) to create a node called 'web' and create a
> [tcp-inlet](https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-tcp-inlet.html). You can simply follow
> these steps on your machine.

Next we'll create and enroll our node, set a policy to say it is only allowed to create
inlet connections to the `db` component, and then finally we create that inlet:

```bash
ockam identity create web
ockam project enroll $WEB_TOKEN --identity web
ockam node create web --identity web
ockam policy create --at web --resource tcp-inlet --expression '(= subject.component "db")'
ockam tcp-inlet create --at /node/web --from 127.0.0.1:5432 --to /project/default/service/forward_to_db/secure/api/service/outlet
```

Take note of the `--from` and `--to` values above. The `--from` is telling the node to
listen on port `5432`, the default postgres port, and to forward it `--to` the forwarder
service to the database that we created in the previous section. This means requests to
`localhost:5432` will be forwarded to whatever node has registered as `db`, wherever it is!

Which means if you start your web app the counter will continue incrementing just as it
did before, with zero code changes to your application

You could also extend this example by moving the Postgres service into a Docker container
or to an entirely different machine. Once the nodes are registered the demo will continue
to work, with no application code changes and no need to expose the Postgres ports
directly to the internet.

Here's a diagram w/ some architecture details of what we have done in this exercise.

### Other commands to explore

Now that you've completed this example, here are some commands for you to try and see what
they do. You can always look up the details on what they do in the
[manual](https://command.ockam.io/manual/). As you try each of these, keep an eye out for
things you may have created in this exercise.

- Try `ockam node list`. Do you see the nodes that you created in this exercise?
- Try `ockam node --help`. These are shorter examples for you to get familiar with
  commands.
- Try `ockam node show web`. Do you see the `tcp-inlet` that you created in this
  exercise?
- Try `ockam node show db`. Do you see the `tcp-outlet` that you created in this
  exercise?
- Try `ockam identity list`. Do you see the identities you created in this exercise?
