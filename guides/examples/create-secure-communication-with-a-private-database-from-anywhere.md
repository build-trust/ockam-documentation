# Create secure communication with a private database, from anywhere

In this example we are going to install a PostgreSQL database on our local machine
(running on port `5432`), and then create a secure communication channel (running on port
`7777`) to it from anywhere.

### Setup PostgreSQL

First let's install PostgreSQL using [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) on macOS or Linux.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please make sure to follow `brew`'s instructions on adding PostgreSQL to your path.
{% endhint %}

```bash
brew install postgresql@15
```

Then, start the PostgreSQL server process.

```bash
# Start the PostgreSQL server process
brew services start postgresql@15

# Create a database
createdb app_db
```

We can verify that the database is running on its default listening port `5432` on
localhost `127.0.0.1` using `psql`. Nothing has been secured yet but our database is
running ðŸŽ‰.

```shell-session
psql --host='127.0.0.1' --port=5432 app_db
```

### Install Ockam

Install the [<mark style="color:blue;">Ockam
command</mark>](https://docs.ockam.io/#quick-start), if you haven't already, by following
the instructions below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ockam Command is our Command Line Interface (CLI) to build and orchestrate secure
distributed applications using Ockam.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Homebrew" %}
If you use Homebrew, you can install Ockam using brew.

```sh
# Tap and install Ockam Command
brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam
```

This will download a precompiled binary and add it to your path. If you donâ€™t use
Homebrew, you can also install on Linux and MacOS systems using curl. See instructions for
other systems in the next tab.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Other Systems" %}
On Linux and MacOS, you can download precompiled binaries for your architecture using curl.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/build-trust/ockam/develop/install.sh | bash
```

This will download a precompiled binary and add it to your path. If the above instructions
don't work on your machine, please [post a
question](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/discussions), weâ€™d love to help.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Create an end-to-end encrypted relay

Next, let's step through the following commands to setup secure and private communication
between our application service and an application client. In a terminal window, run the
following command, which will:

- Check that everything was installed correctly by enrolling with Ockam Orchestrator.
- This will create a Space and Project for you in Ockam Orchestrator and provision an
  End-to-End Encrypted Relay in your `default` project at
  `/project/default`.

```bash
ockam enroll
```

#### Application service (database)

Next, let's setup a `tcp-outlet` that makes a TCP service available at the given address
`5432`. We can use this to send raw TCP traffic to the HTTP server on port `5432`. And
then let's create a relay in our default Orchestrator project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Relays make it possible to establish end-to-end protocols with services operating in a
remote private networks, without requiring a remote service to expose listening ports to
an outside hostile network like the Internet.
{% endhint %}

```bash
ockam tcp-outlet create --to 5432
ockam relay create
```

#### Application client

Let's setup a a local `tcp-inlet` to allow raw TCP traffic to be received on port `7777` before
it is forwarded.

{% hint style="info" %}
A TCP inlet is a way of defining where a node should be listening for connections, and
where it should forward that traffic to.
{% endhint %}

```bash
ockam tcp-inlet create --from 7777
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you can run the application client on a different machine than the one
that is running the application service (database). In this case, you can simply run
`ockam enroll` on the machine running the application client before running the `ockam
tcp-inlet ...` command.
{% endhint %}

#### Access the application service (database) securely

Using the following command we can now access our application service (database), that may
be in a remote private network though the end-to-end encrypted secure channel, via our own
private and encrypted cloud relay ðŸŽ‰.

```
psql --host='127.0.0.1' --port=7777 app_db
```
